# Simple-Linear-Regression-2-Assignment
# Introduction

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. In this project, we will be performing Simple Linear Regression on the delivery_time.csv dataset to analyze the relationship between the delivery time and sorting time.

# Data Description

The delivery_time.csv dataset contains two columns - "Delivery Time" and "Sorting Time". "Sorting Time" represents the time taken to sort the packages, and "Delivery Time" represents the corresponding time taken for the packages to be delivered.

# Methodology
We will be using Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between "Delivery Time" and "Sorting Time". Simple Linear Regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable. We will first visualize the relationship between the two variables using a scatter plot. Then we will fit a linear regression model and check its accuracy using the R-squared value. Finally, we will use the model to make predictions on new data.

# Results

Our analysis showed a positive linear relationship between sorting time and delivery time. The scatter plot showed a clear trend, with the delivery time increasing as the sorting time increased.

The linear regression model had an R-squared value of 0.6823, indicating a moderate correlation between the two variables. This means that 68.23% of the variation in delivery time can be explained by the variation in sorting time.

Using the linear regression model, we can make predictions on the delivery time given the sorting time.

# Conclusion
Simple Linear Regression is a powerful tool for modeling the relationship between two variables. In this project, we used Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between sorting time and delivery time. Our analysis showed a moderate positive linear relationship between the two variables, with the delivery time increasing as the sorting time increased.

This model can be used by delivery companies to optimize their sorting process and estimate the delivery time based on the sorting time. It can also be used by customers to estimate the delivery time of their packages.
